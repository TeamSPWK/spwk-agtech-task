<h2 align="center">Description</h2>

This package contains tasks and instructions for spacewalk Agtech engineer applicants.

[PCSE](https://pcse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (Python Crop Simulation Environment) is a Python package for building crop simulation models, in particular the crop models developed in Wageningen (Netherlands). PCSE is no exception and its source code is open and licensed under the European Union Public License. 

In this task, we need to solve a simple agricultural reinforcement learning problem created by modified PCSE. 

Goal: `MAXIMIZE RETURN!!`

List of environments :

* `PCSE-v0`

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

Install `spwk_agtech` package with : 

(It is recommended to install the package in virtual environment due to dependencies)

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/TeamSPWK/spwk-agtech-task.git
```

<h2 align="center">Get started</h2>

You can use the environment like any other gym environment :

```python
# runner
import spwk_agtech
import gym

env = gym.make("PCSE-v0") # there is just version 0 in now

rews = 0
obs = env.reset()
step = 0
while True:
    step += 1
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    next_obs, rew, done, _  = env.step(action)
    rews += rew
    obs = next_obs
    if done:
        break

```
---
🔎 _If you get `TIMEOUT` error or any errors when getting weather data from NASA POWER server (`gym.make("PCSE-v0")`), Please follow the steps below._

1. Execute module `make_weather_cache`

```console
python -m spwk_agtech.make_weather_cache
```

2. Try re-running the environment again.
3. If it still does not work, please contact us.
