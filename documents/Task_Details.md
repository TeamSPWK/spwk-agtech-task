<h2 align="center">Problem Descriptions</h2>

<h3>MDP design</h3>

- Observation
  - Plant information (9 items) 
  - Soil information (2 items)  
- Action  
  - Weather (9 items)  
  - Irrigation (1 items)  
  - N/P/K application (3 items)  
- Reward 
  - It is calculated profit from yield and cost  
- Done
  - 1 episode will be terminated after 196 steps

 
ðŸ”Ž _you can check details of observations and actions in [const.py](https://github.com/TeamSPWK/spwk-agtech-task/blob/master/spwk_agtech/const.py)_

ðŸ”Ž _you can check details of reward and done in [pcse_env.py](https://github.com/TeamSPWK/spwk-agtech-task/blob/develop/spwk_agtech/pcse_env.py)_

<h3>Goal</h3>

- Maximize `return` (sum of reward)
- (optional) Make generialized agent
  - There are additional test PCSE setting that we do not offer to applicants
  - Good performance on those setting is not mandatory, but recommended
  - Extra points will given for performance on those test setting
- (optional) High stability of training
- (optional) Fast convergence

<h2 align="center">Environment</h2>

<h3>Allowed</h3>

- You can wrap the given environment with your custom environment
    - Given environment provides minimal information to solve the problem
    - It has large range of observations and actions
    - Depends on your method, these information may not sufficient to solve the problem
    - You can create a wrapper environment to generate additional information
    - If you are familiar with some frameworks(like gym, etc.), you can use given environment as a library and create wrapper environment inherits framework you want to use
    - If you create a wrapper environment, you have to submit that as well

<h3>Methods of PCSE-v0</h3>

- `env = gym.make("PCSE-v0")`

- `env.norm(self, obs_act, _type)` and `env.denorm(self, obs_act, _type))`
  - Normalize the observations from PCSE engine to -1 ~ 1
  - Denormalze the actions (-1 ~ 1) from agent to real value
  - args
    - `obs_act (ndarray)`: observations or actions
    - `_type (str)`: the type of `obs_act`. `obs` or `act`


- `env._module_init(self)`
  - Initialize crop, soil, and site modules for PCSE engine

- `env._engine_init(self)`
  - Initialize PCSE engine
  - Call `_module_init`

- `env.reset(self)`
  - Reset environment
  - Call `_engine_init`
  - returns
    - `obs (ndarray)`

- `env.step(self, action)`
  - Apply actions
      - args
          - `action (ndarray)` : 13 actions. Check [const.py](https://github.com/TeamSPWK/spwk-agtech-task/blob/master/spwk_agtech/const.py)
      - returns
          - `next_obs (ndarray)` : It is observed after given actions.
          - `reward` : reward from current actions and next observations.
          - `self.done` : done state
          - `info` : additional information (nothing in now).

- `env.render(self, mode='human')`
  - Print current profit.
  - Render current state. (11 observations from beginning to the present)

<h2 align="center">Submission Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Submission Deadline</h3>

- Applicants are free to set the deadline for submission. However, you must notify us of the deadline in advance.
    - Deadline notification due : Until the day after the test notification mail is sent
    - Please notify us by e-mail (<hychoi@spacewalk.tech>).

You don't have to rush to submit, so give yourself plenty of time.  
Once you fix the deadline, please stick to it.  
If you think you will not be able to do it within the deadline, please notify us by e-mail in advance.  

<h3>Submission List</h3>

- Answer document
    - Answer document should describe in detail how you solved the problem.
    - There is no restrictions on the format of the document, but the document should be sufficiently expressive of how you solved the problem.
    - Please add some images and performance properties of your final results on the document.
    - Training graph have to be attached to the document.
    - We will find not only your theoretical approach, but also your skills to produce proper training information, and to drive the learning with proper tuning.

- code
    - Agent(Problem solver) code have to be submitted.
    - Reproducibility is crucial. If you have additional resources required to reproduce your result, you should include them in your submission (checkpoints, etc.)

(Optional)
- Wrapper environment code
    - If you created wrapper environment code, you should include it in your submission.

Reproducibility with minimum effort is the most important for your submission.  
You don't have to divide your code into agent part and environment part.  
Please attach all things that required for us to reproduce your result.  
If we fail to reproduce your result described on answer document, and if there are no valid cause for the non-reproducibility, your score may be deducted.  

<h3>How to Submit</h3>

- Please submit your submission by e-mail(<hychoi@spacewalk.tech>).

<h2 align="center">Scoring Criteria</h2>

- Problem solving process : 20%
    - Problem solving process have to be scientific.
    - The document should follow your problem solving process.
- Scientific hypothesis : 15%
    - It includes the expected characteristic of the problem, and why you choose the method.
    - The hypothesis have to be reasonable, and scientific.
    - Your hypothesis should be described on the document.
- Phenomenon analysis : 15%
    - Once you validate your hypothesis with experiment, you can get the result.
    - From result, observe phenomenon and analyze it.
    - This analysis have to be described on the document.
- Document & code quality : 15%
    - Document and code should be written in a communicative manner.
- Result performance : 35%
    - Spacewalk is a performance-oriented company, and we will score result performance as well as problem solving procedure.
    - We will retrain your model, and check if the result is same as you described on the document.
    - The criteria of result performance are "final performance", "sample efficiency" and "training stability".
